# 🪞 Check if a Number is Palindrome

### 🔹 What is a Palindrome Number?
A **Palindrome Number** is a number that remains **the same when its digits are reversed**.  
➡️ Example: `121`, `1221`, `4554`, and `7` are palindrome numbers.

---

### 🔹 Why do we check for Palindromes?
- It’s a **common mathematical problem** and helps build logical thinking.  
- Used in **string/number symmetry problems** in interviews.  
- Strengthens understanding of **reverse logic & condition checking**.

---

### 🧠 **Logic Behind It**
1. Reverse the given number.
2. Compare the reversed number with the original.
3. If both are the same → it’s a palindrome.

### 🧩 **Time Complexity**
```
| Type      | Complexity | Explanation                    |
| --------- | ---------- | ------------------------------ |
| **Time**  | O(log₁₀ N) | Loop runs once for each digit. |
| **Space** | O(1)       | Only a few variables used.     |
```

### 🧩 **Key Observations**
- Works for positive integers.
- Negative numbers are not palindrome (e.g., -121 ≠ 121-).
- Based on reverse number logic, similar to the previous topic.

### 🧾 **Summary**
- Builds on the logic of reversing a number
- Compares reversed & original number
- Simple and essential logic in interview questions
