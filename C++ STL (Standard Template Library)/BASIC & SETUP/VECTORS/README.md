# ğŸ“˜ Vectors in C++ STL  

ğŸ”¹ **What is a Vector?**  
A vector in C++ is a dynamic array provided by the Standard Template Library (STL).  
Unlike normal arrays, vectors can change their size during runtime.  

It is defined in the `<vector>` header.

ğŸ”¹ **Why use Vector?**  
- Unlike arrays, vectors are **dynamic** (size can increase or decrease).  
- Provides many **inbuilt functions** to insert, delete, and access elements.  
- Very useful in **DSA problems** for handling lists of numbers, strings, or objects.  
- Random access (like arrays) using index `[]`.
