# Pattern 5 – Inverted Right-Angled Triangle

## Description
Prints an inverted right-angled triangle of stars with n rows.  
The first row contains n stars, and each subsequent row decreases by one star.

## Logic Summary
- Outer loop → runs from n down to 1 (rows)
- Inner loop → prints stars equal to the current row number

## Complexity
- Time Complexity: O(n^2)
- Space Complexity: O(1)

## Example Output (n=5)
