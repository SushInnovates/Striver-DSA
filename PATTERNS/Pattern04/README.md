# Pattern 4 – Repeating Number Pyramid

## Description
Prints a pyramid of numbers with n rows.  
Each row contains the same number repeated, equal to the row number.

## Logic Summary
- Outer loop → runs from 1 to n (rows)
- Inner loop → prints the current row number, repeated row_number times

## Complexity
- Time Complexity: O(n^2)
- Space Complexity: O(1)

## Example Output (n=5)
