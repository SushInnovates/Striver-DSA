Prints a solid rectangle made of stars (*) with n rows and m columns.  
Commonly used to learn nested loops in C++.

## Logic Summary
- Outer loop → controls the number of rows.
- Inner loop → prints m stars in each row.

##Complexity
-Time Complexity: O(n^2)
-Space Complexity: O(1)

**space compleity:**O(1)

## Example Output (row=5, column=5)
