# Pattern 2 – Right-Angled Triangle

## Description
Prints a right-angled triangle of stars with n rows.  
The first row contains 1 star, and each subsequent row increases by one star.

## Logic Summary
- Outer loop → runs from 1 to n (rows).
- Inner loop → prints stars equal to the current row number.

## Complexity
- Time Complexity: o(n^2).
- Space Complexity:o(1).

## Example Output (n=5)
