# Pattern 3 – Number Pyramid

## Description
Prints a pyramid of numbers with n rows.  
Each row contains numbers from 1 up to the row number.

## Logic Summary
- Outer loop → runs from 1 to n (rows).  
- Inner loop → prints numbers from 1 to current row number.

## Complexity
- Time Complexity: O(n^2)  
- Space Complexity: O(1)

## Example Output (n=5)
