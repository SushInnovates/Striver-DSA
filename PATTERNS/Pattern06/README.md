# Pattern 6 – Inverted Number Pyramid

## Description
Prints an inverted pyramid of numbers with n rows.  
The first row contains numbers from 1 to n, each subsequent row has one less number.

## Logic Summary
- Outer loop → runs from n down to 1 (rows)
- Inner loop → prints numbers from 1 up to current row number

## Complexity
- Time Complexity: O(n^2)
- Space Complexity: O(1)

## Example Output (n=4)
