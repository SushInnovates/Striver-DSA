# Pattern 10: Half Diamond

## Description
This pattern prints two right-angled triangles (one increasing and one decreasing) stacked vertically.
The first half increases from 1 star to n stars, and the second half decreases back from n stars to 1 star.

## Logic Summary
- Print the increasing triangle using a loop from 1 to n.
- Print the decreasing triangle using a loop from n down to 1.

## Complexity
- Time Complexity: O(n^2)
- Space Complexity: O(1)

## Example Output (n = 4)
