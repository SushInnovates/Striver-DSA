# Pattern 9: Diamond

## Description
This pattern prints a symmetrical diamond shape of stars. It is formed by combining a pyramid (upper half) and an inverted pyramid (lower half).

## Logic Summary
1. First, print the pyramid (Pattern 7).  
2. Then, print the inverted pyramid (Pattern 8) excluding the middle row to avoid duplication.  

## Complexity
- Time Complexity: O(n^2)
- Space Complexity: O(1)

## Example Output (n = 5)
